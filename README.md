# Connect Four

This repository contains a command line version of the game [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four), implemented using [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code#project-tdd-connect-four).

The game can be played by cloning this repository and running `ruby lib/game.rb`.
